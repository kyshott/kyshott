# **Welcome To My Page**

**I am currently a student at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston, MA. I am pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with minors in Data Science, Physics, and Applied Mathematics.**

**I am particularly interested in and am working to improve my skills in game development, software engineering, machine learning/data science and applied math.**

**AI ethics is a very important topic to me, and I am committed to spreading the message of using AI responsibly in a way that is both environmentally friendly and respectful of other professions and art.**

**There are currently two main projects I am working on - a fully fledged 3D FPS Game in the Godot engine + C# .NET Framework, and a 2D Game Engine made with C++ and SDL2.
